# Bootstrap -- Popeye 🐋

Containerization is a great way to set up a runtime evironment for any application, down to the operating system it needs. But above all, it is not dependent on the host OS on which the containerization service is running. This is an important part of today’s software engineering methods: running everything every- where.

This is like spinaches for programmers: at first, it feels strange and does not taste good, but in the end, you become an incredibly strong sailor that loves those tools and is a master at using them.

During this bootstrap, we are going to become familiar with one of the most popular contain- erization technologies: Docker, and its associated tool Docker Compose.
